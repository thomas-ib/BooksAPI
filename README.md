## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Manage your book collection by creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.
- **In-Memory Data Storage**: Quickly and efficiently test the API without setting up a database.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the "ASP.NET and web development" workload.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/BookAPI.git
   ```

3. **Open and Run**:
   - Open the `BookAPI.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.
   - Press `F5` to run the project.

## Usage

The API supports the following operations:

- **GET**: Retrieve all books or a specific book by ID.
- **POST**: Add a new book.
- **DELETE**: Remove a book by ID.

**Base URL**: `https://localhost:<port>/api/books`

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like:

- **Browser**: Simply navigate to the desired endpoint, e.g., `https://localhost:<port>/api/books`.
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**: A powerful tool for API testing.
- **Curl**: Command line tool for making HTTP requests.

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**: Transition from in-memory data storage to a more robust database solution using Entity Framework.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement security protocols to restrict access to the API.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Incorporate logging mechanisms to monitor API activity and debug issues.
